BirTawil foundation wants to develop an innovative methodology to solve the Climate Change issue and to mitigate Global Warming with the following two projects:
•	The Albedo Control project (see more detail in the related chapter). To implement we will need also labor workforce to get locally to keep the maintenance, repair and operations.
•	The Ecological Water Saving Technology (EWST) is an integrated planting technology to plant in dry, eroded, desert and rocky areas. It is not a way of irrigation.
